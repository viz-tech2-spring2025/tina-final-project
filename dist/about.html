        <h2><strong style="color: #4dff36; ">Project: A Component of a Northeastern MFA Thesis</strong></h2>
        <br>
        <p>This project is a component of a broader Master of Fine Arts thesis in Information Design and Data Visualization at Northeastern University.</p>
        <br>
        <p>It is important to note that the scope of this thesis—and by extension, this project—is exploratory in nature. Its primary aim is to ideate and prototype possible interactive interfaces that facilitate access to large digital archives. As such, the analytical and visualization processes presented here should be understood as preliminary and experimental. They are not intended to represent a final or comprehensive analysis but rather to serve as a foundation for future iterations, encouraging continued refinement, expansion, and exploration through computational and visualization methods.</p>

        <h2><strong style="color: #4dff36; ">Dataset: <a href="https://www.svalbardposten.no" target="_blank" style="color: #4dff36; ">Svalbardposten's</a> Digital Archive</strong></h2>     
        <br>
        <p>The original dataset used for this visualizaiton comprises of 16,786 articles in Norwegian with associated metadata spanning from June 2006 to September 2024. Svalbardposten provided URL access to their RSS feed for research purposes. Data was collected programmatically using Python to access the newspaper's RSS feed and retrieve articles via their unique IDs. While some of the metadata and computational results are presented in this research, the full article texts remain proprietary and are not publicly distributed.</p>
